# Amazon Front Page Clone

This project is a clone of the front page of Amazon, created using HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout and design of Amazon's front page, including the header with navigation bar, search functionality, language selection, sign-in and return options, cart, and various sections for different product categories. 

The CSS styling covers aspects such as navbar, hero section with a message and link, box section for displaying different product categories, and a footer with links and copyright information. The design is responsive, using flexbox for layout and including hover effects for interactive elements.

This project is suitable for learning and practice purposes, showcasing HTML and CSS skills in creating a functional and visually appealing website interface.
